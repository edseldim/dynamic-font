# dynamic-front

The point of this project is to show a dynamic website without using frameworks. It is made for learning purposes only.

## Features

It has 4 features that can be usually found on modern websites:

1. A small bottom message that asks you for some kind of cookies permissions.
2. A dynamic menu that opens or closes.
3. A modal for inputting contact data.
4. Responsive design

## Purpose

It doesn't have any other purpose beyond learning. It can be shared with frontend students to have an example of a dynamic website with pure CSS and JS.
